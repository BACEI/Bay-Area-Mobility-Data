# Mobility-Data
The Mobility Index and Connectivity data were developed by Descartes Labs for the Bay Area Council. Descartes Labs collects anonymous data from a sample of mobile devices reporting their location throughout the day, then calculates the maximum distance moved from the first reported location. The information is de-identified, aggregated, and summarized to protect the privacy of users and communities. More information can be found on their <a href="https://www.descarteslabs.com/mobility/">website</a>, and vizualizations of the data can be found on the Bay Area Council Economic Institute <a href="http://www.bayareaeconomy.org/how-the-bay-area-has-reacted-to-stay-at-home-orders/">website</a>. 

<strong>Mobility Index:</strong>
The Mobility Index shows the change in movement since the Bay Area has been sheltering in place. It references a 100 value based on median distance traveled in each county the week of February 17, 2020. For example, a mobility index of 50 means the median distance traveled is half of what it was during the week of February 17, 2020.
