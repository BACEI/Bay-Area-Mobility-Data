# Mobility-Data
The Mobility Index referenced in this data set has a 100 value based on median distance traveled in each county the week of February 17, 2020. 
  
The Mobility Index was developed by Descartes Labs. Descartes Labs collects anonymous data from a sample of mobile devices reporting their location throughout the day, then calculates the maximum distance moved from the first reported location. The information is de-identified, aggregated, and summarized to protect the privacy of users and communities. More information can be found at descarteslabs.com/mobility and some publicly available data of this nature can be found on their github page github.com/descarteslabs/
